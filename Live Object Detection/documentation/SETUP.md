# Setup

## OpenCV (Required)

Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.0/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html) to install OpenCV onto a Linux machine.

If you run into any problems, you can check out the [*Troubleshooting*](/documentation/troubleshooting/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) section which highlights some of the problems I've encountered while working on this project.

## Saving Weights (Optional)

You can configure the frequency to save the trained weights in the [`detector.c`](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/cce34712f6928495f1fbc5d69332162fc23491b9/src/detector.c#L271) file.
